This project focuses on real-time speech-to-text conversion using Python. 
It captures audio from a microphone, processes it, and converts the spoken language into written text.
It's designed to help automate voice-driven tasks, assist with accessibility, and lay the foundation for voice-enabled applications like chatbots or virtual assistants.

The system utilizes Python's SpeechRecognition library, along with PyAudio to capture real-time voice input.
The recognized text can be stored, displayed, or integrated into other applications for further processing.

 Key Features:
 
      *Real-time voice input from microphone

      *Accurate speech transcription using Google API

      *Lightweight and beginner-friendly setup

      *Can be extended to command systems, subtitles, or accessibility tools

Use Cases:

      *Voice-based command interfaces

      *Hands-free note-taking

      *Accessibility tools for people with disabilities

      *Input for NLP or AI chatbots
